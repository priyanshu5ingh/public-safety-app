## 📝 Problem Statement!

Cities in India are growing rapidly, and with this growth comes the challenge of ensuring citizen safety. Certain areas within cities are statistically more unsafe than others, and there's a need for a comprehensive solution to address these safety concerns. NammaSuraksha aims to provide a software solution that helps citizens stay safe through real-time crime data visualization, incident reporting, and safety resources.

- Clickable areas for detailed crime statistics
- Heatmap visualization of crime-prone areas

### 🆘 Emergency Features
- Quick access to emergency contacts
- SOS button for immediate assistance
- Live location detection
- Safety alerts for unsafe areas

### 📋 Incident Reporting
